# Put your host in all groups that apply. You only need to put config items on one entry
# The groups here affect which group_vars/ files are loaded, along with whatever you
# put on the command line.
#
# Ansible tasks can be filtered on multiple groups for better targetting - see the
# bootstrap role's tasks/main.yml for an example
#
# This file does not do nested groups well - duplicate group names cause weird behaviour
# (eg: an 'aws' group under both linux and windows will read both config files, and
# you'll end up with a windows connection attempt against a linux host). Not that
# duplicate *hosts* names are fine (and expected workflow)
#
# the 'children:' thing is a legacy issue from when this file was in .ini format.
# it means that the subelements are also groups
