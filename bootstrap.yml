# The bootstrapping role is for doing tasks to do minimal initialisation of a
# server, to get it into a state where it can accept its normal playbook.
# Mostly it's about initial admin user setup, allowing further changes to be
# made, but any other "must happen very early on" changes can be made here.

# the bootstrap playbook is only meant to be run once, to bootstrap, and then
# the usual playbook should be run for that server

# To run bootstrap, you will need to put the target host into the bootstrap
# and linux/windows group, and specify the target's initial admin user on
# the commandline. Other playbooks use your normal user, which will need admin
# rights

# ansible-playbook -i [prod|dev] -u $ADMIN_USER --keyfile ~/.ssh/blah.key bootstrap.yml
